# RAW

Welcome to the RAW repository! This repository contains information on various topics such as algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I explore different concepts and write algorithms.

## RAW List

- [Levenshtein Distance](./LevenshteinDistance/README.md)
- [Similarity Rank Engine](./SimilarityRankEngine/README.md)

## Why RAW?

- **R**eadable: I strive to make the content easy to read and understand, even for beginners.
- **A**ccessible: The resources are freely available for anyone to access and learn from.
- **W**ell-structured: The content is organized in a logical and coherent manner to facilitate learning and navigation.

I hope you find this repository helpful as I share my learning experiences and write algorithms. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy learning!
